# Screen Recording WebApp

This document provides a comprehensive guide on how to set up, use, and deploy the Screen Recording WebApp. This application allows users to record their screen directly from their browser and download the video for later use. The application is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js with Express for the backend.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js installed on your system. You can download and install Node.js from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies listed in `package.json`.

## Setting Up the Server

The server is set up using Node.js and Express. To start the server:

1. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
2. Run `node server.js` to start the server.
3. The server will start, and you can access the application by going to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Using the Application

To use the application:

1. Open the application in your web browser.
2. Click on the `Start Recording` button to begin recording your screen. You may be prompted to select which screen or window you wish to record.
3. Once you are done, click on the `Stop Recording` button to end the recording.
4. The recorded video will automatically play back on the screen.
5. You can download the recorded video by clicking on the `Download` link below the video player.

## Files and Directories

The application's structure is straightforward, with the frontend and backend code organized into specific directories:

- `public/`: Contains all the static files served by the Express server.
  - [index.html](screen-recording-webapp/public/index.html): The main HTML file for the application.
  - [styles.css](screen-recording-webapp/public/css/styles.css): Contains the styles for the application.
  - [scripts.js](screen-recording-webapp/public/js/scripts.js): Contains the JavaScript logic for screen recording functionality.
- `server.js`: Sets up and config borrowed the Express server. [View File](screen-recording-webapp/server.js)
- `package.json`: Contains metadata and dependencies for the project. [View File](screen-recording-webapp/package.json)

## Deployment

To deploy the application:

1. Choose a cloud platform or hosting service that supports Node.js deployments, such as Heroku, Vercel, or AWS.
2. Follow the platform's documentation to deploy your application. Typically, this involves pushing your code to a remote repository or directly to the hosting platform.
3. Ensure that the server is configured to serve the `public/` directory as static files.
